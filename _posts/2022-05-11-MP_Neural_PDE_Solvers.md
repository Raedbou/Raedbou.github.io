## Why Deep Learning for physics simulations?
<p>  <div style="text-align: justify"> Many problems in science and engineering (Fluid mechanics, plasticity, quantum mechanics, climate models, biological systems...) are described using Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Most PDEs described real world problems require numerical solutions. For large problems the numerical solutions are computationally expensive. Well established methods to solve PDEs are the Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Element Method (FEM). These methods require a fine spatial discretization of the computational domains and get very slow and inefficient. Many scientists have been trying to overcome these difficulties in classical numerical methods by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) methods. Recently a lot of efforts have been shifted towards Deep Learning (DL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We will kick of this blog post by a brief introduction to  DL and GNNs and then focus on the solution of PDEs using DL and GNNs.  </div> </p>
