## Why Deep Learning for Physics Simulations?

## Graph Neural Networks for Simulation

## Data driven PDE Solvers

You can turn parallel sections to tabs in `html_document` output.

## Results {.tabset}

### Plots

We show a scatter plot in this section.

```{r, fig.dim=c(5, 3)}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .5, .1))
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, pch = 19)
```

### Tables

We show the data in this tab.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

### Neural Operator Methods
### Autoregressive Methods
