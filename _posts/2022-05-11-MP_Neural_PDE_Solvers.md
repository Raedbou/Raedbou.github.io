Many problems in science and engineering (Fluid mechanics, plasticity, quantum mechanics, climate models, biological systems...) are described using Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Most PDEs described real world problems require numerical solutions. For large problems the numerical solutions are computationally expensive. Well established methods to solve PDEs are the Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Element Method (FEM). These methods require a fine spatial discretization of the computational domains and get very slow and inefficient.
